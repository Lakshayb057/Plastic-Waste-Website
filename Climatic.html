            Because single-use plastic is produced from fossil fuels, the process of extracting and creating these plastics emits 
            huge amounts of greenhouse gases.It is estimated that just the extraction of these fossil fuels and their transportation 
            to plastic factories emits 12.5 to 1.5 million metric tons of greenhouse gases.

        <p class="efg">The removal of forested land for oil extraction and pipeline construction has also resulted in over 1.6
            billion metric tons of carbon dioxide being released into the atmosphere. This land clearing also limits the amount 
            of carbon dioxide removed from the atmosphere. The refinement of plastics emits an additional 184 to 213 million 
            metric tons of greenhouse gases each year. Landfills, where thrown out single-use plastics are sent, account for 
            over 15% of methane emissions. The disposal of more plastics to landfills leads to increases in landfill size and 
            theseÂ emissions.

            Single-use plastics are becoming increasingly prevalent across the world. These plastics most obviously create eyesores 
            and pose a threat to the natural ecosystems they make their way into. However, these plastics are also a driving force 
            behind climate change.
